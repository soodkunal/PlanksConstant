    <h3>THEORY:</h3>
    <p>Planck's constant is a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics, denoted by the symbol h. It relates the energy of a photon to its frequency through the equation:
    E = h * f
    where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the photon.
    Idealy the value of Planck's constant is approximately 6.62607015 × 10<sup>-34</sup> joule-seconds (J·s) or kilogram-square meters per second (kg·m<sup>2</sup>/s).
    Planck's constant plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics, as it determines the quantization of energy levels and the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic scales. It is a fundamental constant that underlies many phenomena in physics.
    Planck's constant was first introduced by the German physicist Max Planck in 1900 while studying black-body radiation. His discovery paved the way for the development of quantum theory and revolutionized our understanding of the microscopic world.
    Planck's constant is used in various areas of physics, including quantum mechanics, particle physics, and spectroscopy. It is essential for understanding the behavior of elementary particles, the emission and absorption of light, and the behavior of matter at extremely small scales.
    when a light of suitable frequency falls on mettalic surface the emitted electrons e- of electrons e-these are some part of energy used to do work eject from energy used surface and rest part of energy used in nework function</p>
    Thus, h = e (v₂- V₁)λ2λ1/(c(λ1-λ2))</p>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Set the plank constant apparatus shown in diagram as shown in figure</li>
      <li>Switch on lights source and then connect it to the photocell such as that it should be in one line and +ve end of (100 A) connect to photocell and -ve end (μA) connect to +ve end of V and -ve end connect to the photocell.</li>
      <li>New with the help of stopping potential make (μA) and note the stopping potential readings.</li>
      <li>Now use the filter and again make (μA) Zero with stopping potential.</li>
      <li>Repeat stip this with orange, green,blue filters.</li>
